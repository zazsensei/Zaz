Greetings High Councillor Zaz,

Due to security reasons I do this via email instead of forum.

The Plesk license issue has been resolved and I configured the forum and uploaded the attachments.
Which opens up the next phase: Migrating www and mail services.
I also created a www subdomain and added a few mail addresses in preperation of migrating the old server which is still maintaining www and mail.
The mail dns is still directed at the old server until you let me know your ready for the switch.

Below you'll find a summary of the access information.
Please do not share this information with others as it gives access to all the forum.tgbo.net and www.tgbo.net data, including the posts and passwords stored in the database.

Server main dns: box.tgbo.net
Control Panel: https://box.tgbo.net:8443/
Webmail: http://webmail.tgbo.net/ using mail userdata
POP3/IMAP dns: box.tgbo.net (not tgbo.net and not mail.tgbo.net, although those will be configured the same once the old server is discarded)
ftp services: ftp://box.tgbo.net/ using *.tgbo.net userdata

*.tgbo.net username: guardians
*.tgbo.net password: tgboe8b

your mail username: zaz@tgbo.net
your mail password: sensei

Additionally you should be able to access the mail via pop3, imap or webmail.
However you can, if you wish, configure the mailbox as a redirect using the control panel logged in with your mail username.

I would like to ask if you can upload and prepare the www data, via ftp you can see that space in ./subdomains/www/httpdocs/
its real path is /var/www/vhosts/tgbo.net/subdomains/www/httpdocs/ however I would like to ask if you can make all scripting relative path only.
However this www isn't accessible because the dns is still pointing to the old server. So I created a temporarly subdomain www.dev.tgbo.net (./subdomains/www.dev/httpdocs/) where you can prepare and test the site.

Can you lemme know when you can do this? Tnx alot.
Feel free to communicate with YIM (offline) messages, just keep passwords out of it Smile
